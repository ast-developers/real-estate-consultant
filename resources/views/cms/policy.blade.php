                    2.1 Personally Identifiable Information.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you
                    engage in certain activities via the Company Service, including but not limited to creating an
                    account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the Company Service (collectively,
                    “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. If you
                    elect to engage in an Identification Activity we may ask you to provide us with certain personal
                    information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address, credit
                    card information, telephone number and/or any other information you provide to us, to process your
                    transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions. When
                    you enroll in the Company Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information,
                    such as credit card information. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information
                    we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not
                    provide mandatory information for an Identification Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in
                    that Identification Activity with the Company Service. Depending on the Identification Activity,
                    Company might not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with
                    us. If you enroll in the Company Service through a third party (such as Facebook or Google) then
                    Company may receive Personally Identifiable Information from such third party and by using the
                    Company Service, you consent to such receipt of Personally Identifiable Information and its use
                    pursuant to this Privacy Policy by Company.
                    We may use or share Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and/or services to you,
                    to enable Third-Party advertisers to provide products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes
                    and contests, enhance the operation of the Company Service, improve our marketing and promotional
                    efforts, analyze use of the Company Service, improve the Company Service, and tailor your experience
                    with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable
                    Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce
                    our agreements with you, including our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with
                    applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

                <dt>2.2 Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information
                    that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the
                    Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to the Company Service or
                    otherwise participating in the Company Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the
                    Company Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile
                    carrier information, mobile device information, or general and/or aggregated location data that does
                    constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third-Party Service
                    Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit or use the Company Service
                    using electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this
                    Privacy Policy. Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your mobile device
                    identification and mobile device type, the request type, your mobile carrier, your mobile carrier
                    user identification, and the content of your request, does not by itself identify you to Company,
                    though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal. We use
                    Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Company Service, analyze
                    trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law
                    enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third-Party Service
                    Providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our products and services.

            consumption, including your reviews, tips, photos, videos, check-ins, comments, likes, bookmarks, friends,
            lists, compliments, and account profile. We may display this information through the Company Service, share
            it
            with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.

            opt-out
            of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to your activity on the Company Service and include

            promotional emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at the email listed at the end of this
            Privacy
            Policy or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. We may track your actions
            in
            response to the messages you receive from Company or through the Company Service, such as whether you
            deleted,
            opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others through the Company Service, we may
            store them to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in
            connection with investigations related to the operation and use of the Company Service. We may not deliver
            messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages or requests to exchange reviews for
            compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Company Service via SMS text message, we may log
            phone
            numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge
            recipients
            for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us,
            including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. If you are a
            representative of a business listed on the Company Service, we may contact you, including by phone or email,
            using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your

        <dt>5. Release of Personally Identifiable Information.</dt>
        <dd>We will not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties,
            except as may be required by law.
            We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we
            believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding,
            court order, or legal process served on us, enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or other
            agreements or protect the rights, property or safety of the Company Service,
            users of the Company Service or others.
        </dd>
        <dt>6. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</dt>
        <dd>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Third Party Service Providers and the
            public.
            For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally
            Identifiable Information)
            or use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume
            statistical information
            from our users to administer the Company Service. We may also publish this aggregated information for
            promotional purposes.
            Such data is collected on our behalf and is owned and used by us.
        </dd>
        <dd>We may use Third Party Service Providers to serve ads when you participate in the Company Service.
            These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits and use of the Company
            Service,
            and visits to other websites or locations to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about
            goods
            and services that may be of interest to you.
        </dd>
        <dt>7. Updating Information.</dt>
        <dd>If you are enrolled in the Company Service, you may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information
            by logging into your account and accessing the “Member Profile Page” section of the Company Service.
            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes,
            as out-of-date Personally Identifiable Information may negatively affect the quality of your Company Service
            experience.
        </dd>
        <dt>8. Choices on Collection/Use of Information.</dt>
        <dd>always choose not to provide certain information,
            although a certain level of informationis required to engage and participate in the Company Service.
            Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account,
            if you include personal information in the content you post publicly.
            You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Company Service pseudonymously,
            though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Company Service.
        </dd>
        <dd>Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Company Service
            are only private to the extent that both you and the person you are communicating with keep them private.
            For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it.
            Also, Company may access and disclose such messages during investigations relating to use of the Company
            Service.
        </dd>
        <dt>9. Security of Information.</dt>
        <dd>You can access your Personally Identifiable Information via the Company Service with your password and
            username.
            This password is encrypted. We advise against sharing your password with anyone.
            If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or
            different sign-in protections via that third-party site or service.
            You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and
            protecting your password and/or other sign-in mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer,
            browser, or mobile device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
            Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors,
            may compromise the security of user information at any time.
            If we believe that the security of your information may have been compromised,
            we may seek to notify you of that development. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides
            on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to.
            We may encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure
            that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.
            However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
            As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner
            with
            companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from or
            via the Company Service, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive
            any such information.

                <dt>10.1 Cookies.</dt>
                <dd>To facilitate and customize your experience with the Company Service,
                    we may store cookies on your computer or other similar device through which you access the
                    CompanyService.
                    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer or other device for record-keeping
                    purposes
                    that contains information about you. We use cookies to save you time while using the Company
                    Service,
                    remind us who you are, and track and target your interests to provide a customized experience.
                    Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages
                    you visited,
                    what links you clicked on, and how you used the Company Service.
                    We may use Third Party Service Providers to display advertisements on the Company Service.
                    As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer or similar device.
                    We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies
                    by the Company Service only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Third-Party Service
                    Provider.
                    Most browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you may be able to modify your browser settings
                    to decline cookies.
                    Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Company Service may not

                <dt>10.2 Other Tracking Devices.</dt>
                <dd>We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to
                    track your use of the Company Service, or we may allow our Third-Party Service Providers
                    to use these devices on our behalf. When you access the Company Service or open or click an email,
                    pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action.
                    Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior
                    on the Company Service, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance.
                    We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our marketing partners
                    for the same purposes.

        <dd>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information
            we collect from you via the Company Service. Other websites or services
            that may be accessible through the Company Service may have their own privacy policies
            and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you use, link or visit any such website,

            but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under

            so please use caution when posting any content or providing anything that could be deemed personal
